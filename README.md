# Shelf

Shelf is a pet project of mine to learn more about Java and Spring Boot. It is a web service that allows you to store data and retrieve them later. It is a RESTful API that is built on top of Spring Boot and Spring Data. It uses Postgres as a database and is a backend for a web appliction built in Vue.js.
